# Actionscript

In order to teach myself Actionscript 3.0 I am creating a simple scrolling game
using the following tutorials

https://www.udemy.com/flash-actionscript-30-beginner-to-advanced/
and 
http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/2008/09/17/avoider-game-tutorial-1/

(In progress) 

- Language and Program used:
  - Actionscript 3.0 
  - Adobe Animate CC 2017
  
- Skills used/learned:
  - Game design
  - Asset Art
  - Debugging
  - Actionscript based Object Oriented Programing (I learned how to use Actionscript classes and .as files to keep all code out of the timeline)
  
As I continue to practice my skills I hope to build even more complex games.


All Art and Character Design is my original work
